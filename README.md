#Task 1: Sales Forecasting

#Description
First of all I have split sales data into train and test and have done all the analyses on the training data.
Then I have dropped the coloumns which are not required then I did label encoding to convert string into float and then splitted this training data into training and testing to check accuracy of my model.I have used linear regression and random forest but random forest game more accurate results.
